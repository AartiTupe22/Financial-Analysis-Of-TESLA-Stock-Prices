# Financial-Analysis-Of-TESLA-Stock-Prices using Neural Network


This repository encapsulates an exhaustive examination and prognostication model tailored specifically for Tesla stock prices. Leveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a variant of recurrent neural networks renowned for their adeptness in capturing sequential dependencies, we've engineered a sophisticated system poised to deliver precise forecasting of stock prices, thereby furnishing invaluable insights crucial for both investors and financial analysts alike.

The cornerstone of constructing an effective prediction model lies in the meticulous preprocessing of data. The dataset, sourced from the 'tesla.csv' file, encompasses pivotal columns including 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Adj Close'. In our preprocessing phase, we diligently identified and rectified any instances of null values, safeguarding the integrity of the dataset. Subsequently, employing Standard Scaler, we standardized the data, an indispensable step in optimizing model training efficiency.

Embarking on the journey of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we delved into a myriad of statistical and visual analyses, illuminating various facets of the dataset. Our endeavors encompassed scrutinizing the distribution of trading volumes, conducting autocorrelation analyses, and establishing moving averages. Moreover, we sought to unravel the intricacies of the stock's volatility by visualizing the distribution of daily returns, offering deeper insights into its dynamic behavior.

The crux of our methodology lies in the construction of a robust model primed for accurate forecasting. Our model architecture comprises multiple LSTM layers, fortified with a Dropout layer strategically positioned to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Compiled with the Adam optimizer and anchored by mean squared error as the loss function, our model is meticulously calibrated to optimize predictive performance. The intricacies of our model, encapsulated within its summary and training progression, are vividly depicted in the accompanying code, offering transparency and insight into our methodology.

Venturing into the realm of Prediction and Visualization, we harnessed the potency of our meticulously crafted model to extrapolate stock prices for future dates, meticulously accounting for business days. Subsequently, the obtained results were subjected to an inverse transformation, restoring them to the original data scale, facilitating a seamless comparison against actual stock prices. The resultant visualizations serve as a testament to the efficacy of our model, offering stakeholders a tangible glimpse into the future trajectory of Tesla's stock prices.

In summation, through this project, we've underscored the formidable prowess of LSTM networks in the realm of financial time series prediction. Our innovative approach not only furnishes investors and financial analysts with a reliable tool for comprehending Tesla's future performance but also empowers them to make well-informed decisions, thereby navigating the intricate landscape of financial markets with confidence and acumen.
